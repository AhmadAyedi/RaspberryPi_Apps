Testing the Setup
To manually test Mosquitto, open another terminal on the Raspberry Pi and try:

bash
Copy code
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "sensor/temperature"
Then, in another terminal, publish a test message:

bash
Copy code
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "sensor/temperature" -m "25.5"
If you see 25.5 appearing in the subscriber terminal, Mosquitto is working!
